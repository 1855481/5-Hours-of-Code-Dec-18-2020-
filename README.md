# 5-Hours-of-Code-Dec-18-2020-
This is my repository for the 5 hour project just before the winter break. In order to get a better understanding of embedding images and creating a leaderboard,
I wrote multiple versions of code that all create some type of leaderboard based off of scores. The code for the tables do list out the data gathered about the user slightly differently when compared to each other. In a sense this is good because it gives us variety when the time comes to choosing a leaderboard that properly appeals to our project. I additionally made sure to learn how to embed images into a website.
